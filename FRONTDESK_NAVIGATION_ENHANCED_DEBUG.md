# FrontDesk Dashboard Navigation Issue - Enhanced Debugging

## üîç **Issue Analysis from Console Logs:**

From the provided console logs, I can see the exact problem:

1. **Dashboard loads successfully** - FrontDesk role is recognized
2. **PWD Card loads successfully** - API calls work fine  
3. **When navigating back to Dashboard** - Route protection fails with:
   ```
   ProtectedRoute - Role not allowed: FrontDesk not in Array(2)
   ```

## üîß **Root Cause Identified:**

The issue is that when navigating back to `/dashboard`, it's somehow hitting a route with `allowedRoles: Array(2)` (which contains `['Admin', 'SuperAdmin']`) instead of the unrestricted `/dashboard` route.

This suggests a **route conflict** - likely the `/pwd-card` route is being matched instead of `/dashboard`.

## üîß **Enhanced Debugging Added:**

### 1. **ProtectedRoute Debugging**
- Added `useLocation` to track current pathname
- Logs the exact route being accessed when authorization fails
- Shows which route is causing the permission error

### 2. **FrontDeskSidebar Navigation Debugging**
- Added logging to track which path is being navigated to
- Shows if the sidebar is correctly navigating to `/dashboard`

### 3. **Route Pathname Tracking**
- Added `location.pathname` logging to see exact route matches
- Helps identify if wrong route is being matched

## üß™ **Testing Instructions:**

### **Step 1: Test Current Debugging**
1. Login as FrontDesk (username: `frontdesk`, password: `frontdesk123`)
2. Navigate to PWD Card
3. Navigate back to Dashboard
4. Check console for these specific logs:

### **Expected Debug Output:**

#### **When clicking Dashboard in sidebar:**
```
FrontDeskSidebar - Navigating to: /dashboard
ProtectedRoute - currentUser: Object
ProtectedRoute - allowedRoles: undefined
ProtectedRoute - current pathname: /dashboard
ProtectedRoute - Access granted for role: FrontDesk
```

#### **If route conflict occurs:**
```
FrontDeskSidebar - Navigating to: /dashboard
ProtectedRoute - currentUser: Object
ProtectedRoute - allowedRoles: Array(2)
ProtectedRoute - current pathname: /pwd-card  <-- This would show the problem
ProtectedRoute - Role not allowed: FrontDesk not in Array(2)
```

## üéØ **What to Look For:**

1. **Navigation Path:** Does `FrontDeskSidebar - Navigating to: /dashboard` appear?
2. **Route Matching:** Does `current pathname: /dashboard` or `current pathname: /pwd-card`?
3. **Role Restrictions:** Does `allowedRoles: undefined` or `allowedRoles: Array(2)`?

## üîç **Potential Solutions:**

Based on the debug output, we can determine:

### **If pathname shows `/pwd-card`:**
- Route conflict - React Router is matching wrong route
- Need to fix route ordering or add more specific routes

### **If pathname shows `/dashboard` but allowedRoles is Array(2):**
- Route definition issue - wrong route being rendered
- Need to check route configuration

### **If navigation shows wrong path:**
- Sidebar navigation issue
- Need to fix navigation logic

## üìã **Files Modified:**

1. **`pwd-frontend/src/App.js`**
   - Added `useLocation` import
   - Enhanced ProtectedRoute with pathname logging
   - Added route-specific debugging

2. **`pwd-frontend/src/components/shared/FrontDeskSidebar.js`**
   - Added navigation path logging
   - Enhanced SidebarItem click handler

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

The enhanced debugging will show us exactly:
- Which path the sidebar is navigating to
- Which route React Router is actually matching
- What role restrictions are being applied

This will pinpoint the exact cause of the route conflict and allow us to implement the correct fix.

## üîß **Likely Fix:**

Based on the symptoms, the issue is probably:
1. **Route ordering conflict** - `/pwd-card` route interfering with `/dashboard`
2. **Wildcard route matching** - Some route pattern matching incorrectly
3. **Navigation redirect** - Some logic redirecting to wrong route

The debug logs will confirm which scenario is occurring.
