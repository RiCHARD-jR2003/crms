# FrontDesk Dashboard Navigation Issue - DEBUGGING ADDED

## üîç **Issue Reported:**
FrontDesk user gets "unauthorized access" when navigating back to dashboard from PWD Card page.

## üîß **Debugging Added:**

### 1. **Enhanced Error Handling in PWDCard Component**
- Added specific handling for 401/403 authentication errors
- Prevents API errors from affecting parent component authentication
- Added detailed error logging

### 2. **Added Debug Logging to ProtectedRoute**
- Logs currentUser and allowedRoles for each route access
- Shows when user is redirected to login or unauthorized page
- Tracks role-based access decisions

### 3. **Added Debug Logging to Dashboard Route**
- Logs currentUser and role information
- Shows which dashboard component is being rendered
- Displays fallback message if no matching role found

## üß™ **Testing Instructions:**

### **Step 1: Login as FrontDesk**
1. Login with credentials:
   - Username: `frontdesk`
   - Password: `frontdesk123`

### **Step 2: Navigate to PWD Card**
1. Click "PWD Card" in the sidebar
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. Note if the page loads successfully

### **Step 3: Navigate Back to Dashboard**
1. Click "Dashboard" in the sidebar
2. Check browser console for debug logs
3. Look for these specific log messages:
   - `ProtectedRoute - currentUser:` (should show user object)
   - `ProtectedRoute - allowedRoles:` (should be undefined for dashboard)
   - `Dashboard route - currentUser:` (should show user object)
   - `Dashboard route - Rendering FrontDeskDashboard` (should appear)

### **Step 4: Check for Errors**
Look for these error patterns in console:
- `Authentication error in PWDCard:`
- `ProtectedRoute - No currentUser, redirecting to login`
- `ProtectedRoute - Role not allowed:`
- `Dashboard route - No matching role`

## üîç **Expected Debug Output:**

### **Successful Navigation:**
```
ProtectedRoute - currentUser: {userID: X, username: "frontdesk", role: "FrontDesk", ...}
ProtectedRoute - allowedRoles: undefined
ProtectedRoute - Access granted for role: FrontDesk
Dashboard route - currentUser: {userID: X, username: "frontdesk", role: "FrontDesk", ...}
Dashboard route - currentUser.role: FrontDesk
Dashboard route - Rendering FrontDeskDashboard
```

### **If Authentication Fails:**
```
ProtectedRoute - currentUser: null
ProtectedRoute - No currentUser, redirecting to login
```

### **If Role Issue:**
```
ProtectedRoute - Role not allowed: FrontDesk not in [Admin, SuperAdmin]
```

## üéØ **Next Steps:**

Based on the console output, we can determine:

1. **If currentUser is null:** Authentication context issue
2. **If role is wrong:** User data corruption
3. **If API errors:** Backend permission issue
4. **If routing issue:** Route configuration problem

The debug logs will help identify the exact cause of the "unauthorized access" error.

## üìã **Files Modified:**

1. **`pwd-frontend/src/components/cards/PWDCard.js`**
   - Enhanced error handling for authentication errors
   - Added specific 401/403 error detection

2. **`pwd-frontend/src/App.js`**
   - Added debug logging to ProtectedRoute component
   - Added debug logging to dashboard route rendering
   - Enhanced role-based dashboard selection logic

## üöÄ **Status:**

Debugging infrastructure is now in place. The next step is to test the navigation flow and analyze the console output to identify the root cause of the unauthorized access issue.
