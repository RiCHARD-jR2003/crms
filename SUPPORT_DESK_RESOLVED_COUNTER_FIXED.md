# Support Desk Resolved Counter - FIXED! ✅

## 🔍 **Issue Identified:**

The "Resolved" counter was only showing resolved tickets when viewing the Archive tab, but it should **always show all resolved tickets** regardless of which tab is selected.

### **Previous Behavior:**
- **Active Tickets tab**: Resolved = 0 (always)
- **Archive tab**: Resolved = Archived tickets count
- **Result**: Resolved counter showed 0 when viewing Active Tickets, even if there were resolved tickets

### **Expected Behavior:**
- **Resolved**: Should always show the count of all archived/resolved tickets
- **Consistent**: Same resolved count regardless of which tab is selected

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. AdminSupportDesk.js Fixed:**
```javascript
// Before:
const resolvedTickets = showArchive ? archivedTickets.length : 0;

// After:
const resolvedTickets = archivedTickets.length; // Always count all archived tickets
```

### **2. PWDMemberSupportDesk.js Fixed:**
```javascript
// Before:
{showArchive ? archivedTickets.length : 0}

// After:
{archivedTickets.length}
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **Counter Logic:**
- **Open Tickets**: Counts only active tickets with 'open' status
- **In Progress**: Counts only active tickets with 'in_progress' status  
- **Resolved**: **Always counts all archived tickets** (regardless of current tab)
- **Total Tickets**: Always counts Active + Archived tickets combined

### **Example Scenario:**
- **Active Tickets**: 1 ticket (In Progress)
- **Archived Tickets**: 2 tickets (Resolved)
- **Resolved Counter**: **2 tickets** (always shows archived count)
- **Total Tickets**: **3 tickets** (1 + 2 = 3)

## 📋 **Files Updated:**

1. **`pwd-frontend/src/components/support/AdminSupportDesk.js`** ✅ Fixed resolved calculation
2. **`pwd-frontend/src/components/support/PWDMemberSupportDesk.js`** ✅ Fixed resolved calculation

## 🚀 **Expected Results:**

- ✅ **Resolved counter** now always shows the count of all archived tickets
- ✅ **Consistent count** regardless of which tab is selected
- ✅ **Accurate representation** of resolved tickets in the system
- ✅ **Better user experience** with correct ticket statistics

## 🔍 **Testing:**

1. **Navigate to Support Desk**
2. **Check Resolved counter** - should show all archived tickets count
3. **Switch between Active Tickets and Archive tabs**
4. **Verify Resolved counter** remains the same (showing all archived count)
5. **Confirm other counters** work as expected

## 📊 **Counter Summary:**

| Counter | Logic | Behavior |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Open** | Active tickets with 'open' status | Shows only when viewing Active tab |
| **In Progress** | Active tickets with 'in_progress' status | Shows only when viewing Active tab |
| **Resolved** | All archived tickets | **Always shows all archived tickets** |
| **Total** | Active + Archived tickets | **Always shows combined count** |
