   ```

2. **Using Accessibility Features**:
   ```javascript
   import { useAccessibility } from '../contexts/AccessibilityContext';
   
   const { speak, announceToScreenReader } = useAccessibility();
   
   // Speak text
   speak("Hello world");
   
   // Announce to screen reader
   announceToScreenReader("Form submitted successfully");
   ```

3. **Adding ARIA Labels**:
   ```jsx
   <Button
     aria-label="Submit form"
     aria-describedby="form-help"
     onClick={handleSubmit}
   >
     Submit
   </Button>
   ```

## Testing Accessibility

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Screen reader compatibility (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation
- [ ] High contrast mode functionality
- [ ] Large text mode functionality
- [ ] Text-to-speech functionality
- [ ] Language switching
- [ ] Focus indicators visibility
- [ ] Skip links functionality

### Automated Testing

- Use axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- Lighthouse accessibility audit
- WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)

## Browser Support

- **Chrome**: Full support for all features
- **Firefox**: Full support for all features
- **Safari**: Full support for all features
- **Edge**: Full support for all features

## Performance Considerations

- Translation files are loaded on demand
- Speech synthesis doesn't block UI
- Accessibility settings are cached in localStorage
- Language switching is optimized for minimal re-renders

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Languages**: Support for more Philippine languages
2. **Voice Commands**: Voice control for navigation
3. **Braille Support**: Integration with braille displays
4. **Sign Language**: Video support for sign language
