# Support Desk Total Tickets Counter - FIXED! ✅

## 🔍 **Issue Identified:**

The "Total Tickets" counter was only counting tickets from the currently active tab (either Active Tickets OR Archive), but it should count tickets from **BOTH tabs combined**.

### **Previous Behavior:**
- **Active Tickets tab**: Total = Active tickets only
- **Archive tab**: Total = Archived tickets only
- **Result**: Counter showed different values depending on which tab was selected

### **Expected Behavior:**
- **Total Tickets**: Should always show Active tickets + Archived tickets combined
- **Consistent**: Same total count regardless of which tab is selected

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. AdminSupportDesk.js Fixed:**
```javascript
// Before:
const totalTickets = currentTickets.length;

// After:
const totalTickets = tickets.length + archivedTickets.length;
```

### **2. PWDMemberSupportDesk.js Fixed:**
```javascript
// Before:
{showArchive ? archivedTickets.length : tickets.length}

// After:
{tickets.length + archivedTickets.length}
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **Counter Logic:**
- **Open Tickets**: Counts only active tickets with 'open' status
- **In Progress**: Counts only active tickets with 'in_progress' status  
- **Resolved**: Counts only archived tickets (when viewing archive) or 0 (when viewing active)
- **Total Tickets**: **Always counts Active + Archived tickets combined**

### **Example Scenario:**
- **Active Tickets**: 1 ticket (In Progress)
- **Archived Tickets**: 3 tickets (Resolved)
- **Total Tickets**: **4 tickets** (1 + 3 = 4)

## 📋 **Files Updated:**

1. **`pwd-frontend/src/components/support/AdminSupportDesk.js`** ✅ Fixed total calculation
2. **`pwd-frontend/src/components/support/PWDMemberSupportDesk.js`** ✅ Fixed total calculation

## 🚀 **Expected Results:**

- ✅ **Total Tickets counter** now shows the sum of Active + Archived tickets
- ✅ **Consistent count** regardless of which tab is selected
- ✅ **Accurate representation** of all tickets in the system
- ✅ **Better user experience** with correct ticket statistics

## 🔍 **Testing:**

1. **Navigate to Support Desk**
2. **Check Total Tickets counter** - should show Active + Archived count
3. **Switch between Active Tickets and Archive tabs**
4. **Verify Total Tickets counter** remains the same (showing combined count)
5. **Confirm other counters** (Open, In Progress, Resolved) work as expected

**The Total Tickets counter now accurately reflects the combined count from both Active and Archive tabs!** 🎉

**Test the support desk to verify the Total Tickets counter now shows the correct combined count!** 📊
